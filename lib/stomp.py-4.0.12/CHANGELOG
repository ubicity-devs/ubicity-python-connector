Version 4.0.10 - Jan 2014

 * Fix problem with heartbeat listener (see https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/4 for more info)
 * Add alternate aliases for the connection classes
 * Add initial version multicast adapter (providing an interface to use the stomp.py API and send messages via multicast) 
 	- note: work in progress


Version 4.0.6 - Dec 2013

 * Fix missing headers in connect func
 * Throw ConnectFailedException when a connection fails in the 1.2 protocol - if wait=True is set


Version 4.0.5 - Nov 2013

 * Add command-line subscription listener. So you can do:
     > stomp -H localhost -P 61613 -L /queue/test
 * Add verbose option to command-line client (verbose "on" by default, if "off", headers aren't written to stdout)
 * Fix problem with connect wait (should not wait if the connection fails)
 * Throw exception when the connect fails (only if wait=True)
 * Add PrintingListener (useful for debugging)
 

Version 4.0.4 - Nov 2013

 * Fix ack/nack function inconsistencies in each protocol version (as per https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/issues/1)


Version 4.0.3 - Nov 2013

 * Add script for cmd line access (so you can run `stomp -H localhost -P 61613` rather than python $PATH_TO_STOMP/stomp ....)


Version 4.0.2 - Oct 2013

 * Fix minor error with 1.2 connections. Add basic unit tests for 1.0, and 1.2


Version 4.0.1 - Oct 2013
 
 * Remove the 'transform' method/functionality, as this never went into the official spec. Clients who still want this should
   implement themselves, using a listener (see https://github.com/jasonrbriggs/stomp.py/blob/master/stomp/test/misc_test.py for
   an example)
 * Add support for STOMP 1.2 line endings
 * Enforce "host" header on 1.2 connect requests (note: should be enforced on 1.1 connections, but it seems rabbitmq connections
   fail if host is set)


Version 4.0.0 - Oct 2013

 * Separate protocol from transport mechanism, to improve the ability to support multiple protocol versions. Note: constructor
   args are changing accordingly.
 * Add initial support for STOMP 1.2
 * Moved username and passcode params out of constructor and into the connect method. The basic connection process is therefore now:
 
     > conn = stomp.Connection([('localhost', 61613)])
     > conn.start()
     > conn.connect('admin', 'password', wait=True)


Version 3.1.6 - Sep 2013

 * Integrate fix for threading primitives issue (http://code.google.com/p/stomppy/issues/detail?id=53)

 * Change test hosts and ports so that they're provided from the setup.py file
